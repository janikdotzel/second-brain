# Tasks

### Invest short-term money in Trade Republic
Trade Republic has an interest rate of 4% currently.
I want to store any money that I'm not using at the moment, but want to have available here.

- [x] Move all my money from DKB to Trade Republic (not the tax money)
### Invest long-term money in a world ETF
A world ETF is a relatively secure investment option that should give me a higher return than a bank account. Buying single shares is speculating and gambling.
It is a long-term investment and I do not want to pull out this money. 
It should be saved for a house.

- [ ] Research the best ETF broker (I guess it's trade republic)
- [ ] Set up a monthly investment of 1k from my Sparkasse to Trade Republic to a World ETF
